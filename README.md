# Project #5: Out of Bounds

#### Link: https://out-of-bounds.herokuapp.com/

## Project Details & Story of Progress
  For this project, the instructions were very general - a CRUD application with a technical stack as agreed upon with your instructor.

  My ambition was to push myself to learn Ruby on Rails with a React front-end and incorporate user authentication within the two week time frame given for this project. To start, I spent a lot of time familiarizing myself with the terms, methods, and functionality of Ruby on Rails and creating small applications.

  About a week and a half into the project, I found myself becoming frustrated and lost because after the user logged in, I was unable to get the user session to stick to other pages. It is something I would like to continue exploring and practicing, but I did ultimately abandon my first attempt.

  For my second attempt, I decided to simplify the project by dropping user authentication, but added a new CSS framework, Bulma (https://www.bulma.io/). Building a less complex application is probably what I should have done from the beginning.

## The Challenges

  The first challenge was pushing myself to learn a whole new language and produce a project within the time frame. However, I found this to be a fun challenge because I enjoy pushing my skills and learning new things.

  Another challenge was learning a new CSS framework, Bulma. I like this framework for the customization - it seems like it has a lot of potential.

  I still have a lot to learn with Ruby on Rails, it seems like very powerful language. Some of my future projects will include Ruby on Rails.

## Areas for Improvement

  -Building out user authentication.

  -Getting the content of the reply to appear

  -Including images when submitting a post (potentially a database full of ski area trail maps).
